Class 2: 	MSP
-------------------------------------------------------

• Recap from Class 1 and New Materials
	⁃ Introduce Sends and Receives
	⁃ Adding Color

• Synthesis
	⁃ Amplitude
		⁃ Visualizing
			- understanding [number~] & how to limit for saftey
			- [meter~]
			- [levelmeter~] 
		⁃ Mixing	 		= [gain~]
		⁃ Envelopes 		= [function]
		⁃ Selecting		= [selector~]
	⁃ Waveforms: The Building Blocks
		⁃ Sine 	 		= [cycle~]
		⁃ Square 		= [rect~]
		⁃ Saw	 		= [saw~]
		⁃ Triangle 		= [tri~]
		⁃ White Noise 	= [noise~]
		⁃ Pink Noise 	= [pink~]	 
	⁃ Effects
		⁃ Delay 			= [delay~]
		⁃ Delay+Feedback= [tapin~] & [tapout~] 
		⁃ Reverb			= [yafr2] (reverb_example.maxpat)		
		⁃ Filters		= [biquad~] + [filtergraph]

	extra: look at oscsync.maxpat


• Making it Fun
	⁃ Modulation using Sequencers and Envelopes [techno~] 
	⁃ Using MIDI Controllers: [notein] & [ctlin] 
	⁃ Presets	= [preset]
	⁃ Adding an Interface in Presentation Mode

• Sampling
	⁃ Streaming		[sfplay~] 
	⁃ Buffers		[buffer~ test]
		⁃ Viewing the Buffer [waveform~]
	⁃ Creating a Drum Machine

Assignment:
	Stockhausen Studie - II 	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studie_II
	Create your 2 minute Composition using your own synthesizers and sequencers.
	Try experimenting with effects, scales and sampling, then record your output using [sfrecord~].
